/**
 * @title DeepStrictMerge Type
 *
 * A type that deeply merges two object types, `Target` and `Source`.
 * Nested objects are recursively merged, and in the case of array types, the elements of the arrays are merged into a new type.
 *
 * Merge Rules:
 * 1. For object types, if both `Target` and `Source` have a common key, the value from `Target` takes precedence, and `Source` does not overwrite it.
 * 2. For array types, if both `Target` and `Source` are arrays and their elements are objects, those elements are merged.
 *    - If the elements of the arrays are not objects, merging is not possible.
 * 3. If only one of the types is an array, merging is not possible.
